	* mono-profiler-logging.c (detect_fast_timer): Add missing return type.

2008-08-22  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Backported fixes from trunk (making it
	identical to r111250):
	- r111250 (correct accounting of allocations happening at JIT time).
	- r111096 (emit directives blocks).
	- r111095 (stack tracking).
	- r109120 (fix bug 412473).
	- r109069 (fix allocation summaries).
	- r108633 (emit full type names for loaded classes, by Rodrigo Kumpera).
	- r108632 (use the "runtime initialized" hook to register the thread).

2008-07-04  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix an embarassingly stupid problem with
	buffer sizes.

2008-07-03  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Changed the way to wait for the writer
	thread to avoid passing an invalid handle to pthread_join.

2008-06-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: When offloading flushing to the writer
	thread, first check that it still exists.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Offload more flushing to the writer thread,
	and fix the shutdown sequence.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Made so that at appdomain unload the
	buffers are flushed by the profiler worker thread (which we know
	is registered with the runtime).

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added more logging code.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Record also the domain of each statistical
	hit, so that mono_jit_info_table_find works properly.

2008-06-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed breakage introduced in r105966

2008-06-17  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Implemented signal based enable-disable
	toggling for the statistical and enter-exit events.

2008-06-17  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (write_statistical_hit): Use the proper
	domain instead of trying to get one.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (module_end_load, assembly_end_load):
	Properly check the return value of "mono_assembly_fill_assembly_name",
	otherwise "mono_stringify_assembly_name" can crash.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix a segfault on shutdown (see Marek's
	fix for the default profiler in r105466, the problem is the same.

2008-06-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Initial implementation of summary report
	for allocations at each collection.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix warnings x86 and remove debugging code.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the build on x86.

2008-05-23  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Support call chains (backtrace) in the
	stat profiler.

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (handle_heap_profiling): Flush all data
	buffers, so that objext allocation events are written before the heap
	description (which contains the "object free" events).

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added support for a global counter of all
	garbage collections, so that the file decoder can correlate the
	events properly.

2008-05-12  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed a bug that prevented using rdtsc,
	and enabled rdtsc by default,adding a command line option to revert
	to using gettimeofday.

2008-05-02  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c: Turned DEBUG_STATISTICAL_PROFILER off...

2008-05-02  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c : Rework statistical profiler, adding the
	 ability to scan symbol tables in elf files instead of using dladdr
	 (dladdr skips lots of symbols which this way we get correctly).

2008-04-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c (gc_event): Fix deadlock condition.

2008-04-16  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	 * mono-profiler-logging.c (write_current_block): Added an incremental
	 "counter delta" field to the block header, so that each block has a
	 timestamp directly in the header.
	 This will allow tools to know when a block has been emitted without
	 decoding (even without reading) the block contents.
	 So, if the user is only interested in blocks emitted in a certain
	 time interval, the tool can seek into the file instead of reading the
	 block contents.
	 Of course this breaks the file format, but at this stage we can still
	 do it, and... better now than later.

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c (profiler_heap_scan): removed debugging code
	and therefore removed unconditional inclusion of signal.h (it is now
	included anyway on Unix platforms).

2008-04-10  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added possibiliy of requesting heap
	snapshots with a signal (like heap-shot).

2008-04-02  Rodrigo Kumpera <rkumpera@novell.com>

	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fix the arm build. G_BREAKPOINT() does
	a "raise(SIGTRAL)" and in some platforms <signal.h> must be included.

2008-03-28  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Added option to append a suffix to the
	default file name.

2008-03-27  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: setup_user_options: set default log file
	name to the name of the executed application.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* Makefile.am: enabled the logging profiler on Linux.

2008-03-26  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Attach and detach the writer thread.

2008-03-25  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed bug with memory region indexes.

2008-03-18  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c:
	OPEN_FILE(): Fixed file creation.
	[UN]LOCK_PROFILER(): Removed logging message.

2008-03-11  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: Fixed heap profiler, added a new way to
	get the symbol names for unmanaged functions, and fixed lots of bugs.

2008-01-08  Massimiliano Mantione <massi@ximian.com>
	* mono-profiler-logging.c: First code drop of new logging profiler
	(and shamefully forgot to set HAS_OPROFILE to 0...).
	* Makefile.am: Added logging profiler, but commented in out to avoid
	breaking the build on Windows.

2005-07-25  Zoltan Varga  <vargaz@freemail.hu>

	* mono-cov.c: Applied patch from Iain McCoy (iain@mccoy.id.au). Fixes
	#75619.

2003-11-12  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: Change default assembly name to mscorlib.dll
	
Tue Jul 1 11:26:10 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: added.

Mon Jun 16 18:21:26 CEST 2003 Paolo Molaro <lupus@ximian.com>

	* mono-cov.c: coverage profiler.
