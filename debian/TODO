TODO soon:
 - Finalize control file, decide on all package names.
 - Choose a good policy for future class package
   mono-classes-foobar sounds okay, or maybe cli-classes-foobar
 - after install, replace all the wrappers with symlinks to our
   debian/cli-wrapper and install cli-wrapper in /usr/bin
 - svn-inject of the mcs package and move the chunks from debian/control
   to it, reviewing (discuss this!)
