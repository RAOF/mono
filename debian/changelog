mono (0.29.99.20040114-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer: Debian Mono maintainers <pkg-mono-devel@alioth.debian.org>
    after the previous maintainers stoped the work on it
  * Package descriptions written or improved
  * Library package separation to follow the shared libs conventions
    (libmono and libmono-profiler-... seem to belong together, though)
  * libmono-dev depends on libmint-dev since the last contains the headers and
    is available on all supported arches
  * Package renaming to avoid confusion (mono in mono-jit, mint in mono-mint)
  * merged binfmt-detector-cli and mono-common since they were already linked
    together and another 3kB package makes no much sense
  * limited the arch list to those officially supported by the Mono Project
  * Adapted the /usr/share/doc/mono-interpreter (now -mint) fixing hooks

mono (0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Sorry I havn't been doing any CVS snapshots for
     a month. I'll try and sort something out.
  * Include a patch from Michel Danzer <daenzer@debian.org> to fix
     idiotic build failure on non-i386 arches.
  * Install /etc/mono/config and the manpage in the mono-common package,
     and add a replaces for smooth upgrades (mono-config.5 used to be in
     the mono-jit package).
  * Switch from setting prefix to DESTDIR so /etc works too.
  * Added some {}s to monoburg.y to make it parse correctly. Thanks to
     Zoltan Varga's message on mono-list.
  * Added data/config to the list of files that need to be cleaned 
     manually.

 -- Robert McQueen <robot101@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Aug 2002 00:36:34 +0100

mono (0.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass --disable-shared to configure, and link mono-jit statically.
  * This turned out to be broken. Thanks to Dick Porter for putting up
     with me moaning about libtool combinations for a day, and for fixing
     it with the correct method I absolutely failed to see. Applied his
     patch for this, should hit CVS soon or I'll back it out.
  * Ship only a static libmono-dev for people interested in embedding.
     Shared lib is useless because the API is massively unstable.
  * Conflict the -dev with the old libmono0 until it is deemed useful
     again.
  * Change -a to -s in the binary-arch target so debhelper will only
     build arch-specific packages if they're available on the build arch.
  * Added mono-config.5 manpage to mono-jit package, and libmono.la and
     pkg-config/mono files to libmono-dev package.

mono (0.13-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Holiday maintainer upload. =)
  * Switched to pristine upstream source tarball.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules file, separated binary-arch/binary-indep
     targets for builds on other arches.
  * Stole the makefile magic from galeon (I did help write it =) to
     automatically run configure or autogen.sh depending on whether we're
     building from CVS or not, and then do the correct clean command
     later.
  * At the advice of Ximian folk, don't provide libmono0/libmono-dev for
     the moment - the API is unstable.
  * For when it does return... install the .a into libmono-dev and make
     it arch: any.
  * Include libmono.so.0 and libmono.so.0.0.0 into the mono-jit package.
     These will be returned to a seperate package, and headers and static
     libraries provided, when libmono's API is stable. To ease
     transition, added a Replaces: header.
  * Made mono-common arch: all, it contains no binaries currently.
  * Leave out cil-opcodes.xml unless someone complains.
  * Install documentation in mono-common, and have packages that depend
     on it symlink to there instead. Made mono depend directly on
     mono-common to prevent lintian griping about this. Added code to
     postinsts of mono, mono-jit and mono-interpreter remove their doc
     dir and replace it with a symlink on upgrades. Dpkg will not replace
     a directory with a symlink, even if it's empty.
  * Added -e to /bin/sh in the maintainer scripts.
  * Don't ship monostyle.1 and monoburg.1 manpages, the programs are in
     the mcs package and we don't ship them currently.
  * Added undocumented symlink for monograph.1.
  * Added rm to clean target for spare Makefiles left behind.
