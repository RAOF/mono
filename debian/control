  - generics
  - iterators (yield)
  - nullable value types
  - partial types
  - anonymous methods
  - static classes
  - coalesce operator: ??
 .
 With C# 3.0 it supports:
  - Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
  - object initializers
  - collection initializers
  - anonymous types
  - local variable type inference
  - implicitly-typed arrays
  - lambda expressions
  - automatic properties
  - extension methods
  - partial methods
 .
 This compiler targets the CLI 2.0 runtime version.
