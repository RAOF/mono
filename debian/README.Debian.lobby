mono for Debian
---------------

Because MONO requires a development version of the ICU library, the
i18n support is limited. The library is not available in Debian because
of the usual unpredictable compatibility issues with unreleased
libraries.
Please contact the Mono and ICU developers if you wish to improve this
situation.
