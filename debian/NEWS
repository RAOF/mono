mono (0.96-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * It has been quite a while since the last Mono release in Debian and
    we feel that it's time to announce few things changed in the
    meantime:

 - dependencies management and debhelper integration - the new
   mono-utils package contains scripts to create and manage dependencies
   between the .NET library packages.  They work in a similar way to the
   .shlibs system in Debian. For more details, see dh_makenetlibs(1),
   dh_netdeps(1) and monodoc's rules file as example.
   Another script available now is dh_installxsp which will install
   snippets of configuration files for XSP packages (HTML/ASP.NET server
   and Apache module).

 - the GAC - except of mscorlib.dll, all DLLs are moved into
   /usr/share/dotnet hierarchy and are now loaded using the GAC (Global
   Assembly Cache) method. This also makes sane versioning possible,
   similar to SONAME handling on native shared libraries.
 
 - see README.Debian for further details about changes and the current
   .NET Debian policy
